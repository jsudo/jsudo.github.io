  What are the benefits of version control?
  <br>
There are many benifits to using a version control system. One is that when changes are made to a web page or piece of software, or app, etc.. the changes can be isolated to a single testable area called a branch. within this branch changes can be made and tested on a copy of the original without affecting the original and can later be easily combined with the original if the changes were to your liking.

<p>
How does git help you keep track of changes?
<br>
Git helps you to keep track of changes by meticulously recording every single detail that has occured on the system, remote and local, if the files have been staged, prepped to be tracked by git.

Why use GitHub to store your code?
<br>
You should use github to store your code because it could be a lifesaver if you have mishaps with changes and/or upgrades to your projects. And also it could be a lifesafer if a server goes down and takes your files with it, github could give you a way to recover the files, by starting with a fresh copy.
