</h1>

						The best practices associated with using classes vs ids are 1.Classes should be used when there are many items that need changes or when there is a possibility that in the future elements will need the same styling as the rules that were created in your classes. 2. Id's should be used when there will only be one occasion for the rules to be used, basically in special or unique situations. 

						In the css video the instructor talked about how we should always default to classes and hardly ever use id's. His reasoning was that if we created more pages or updated the site or found other uses that called for us to reuse parts of our code we would need classes to achieve that and id's would fall short.
