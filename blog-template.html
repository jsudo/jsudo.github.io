					You should use github to store your code because it could be a lifesaver if you have mishaps with changes and/or upgrades to your projects. And also it could be a lifesafer if a server goes down and takes your files with it, github could give you a way to recover the files, by starting with a fresh copy.

<!-- 
	How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

	It was fun, I enjoyed creating the wireframe and the html page, starting to get the hang of the whole process and workflow, which makes it more enjoyable and less stressful. 

	Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, I did find wireframing to be very helpful in the develping process because it allowed me to map things out better and gave me more freedom to be creative because I could actually visualize what the page may look like.

	What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

	I decided that what makes a good wireframe is a wireframe that contains not too many elements and that is actually possible to construct in html, instead of something that looks good but is too dificult to create. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

	I learned a little about the article, section, and header elements in previous lessons, and bettered my understanding while using them again in this challenge.
