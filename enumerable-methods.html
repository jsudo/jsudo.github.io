           <p>The definition of the enumerator map -> Returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. And if no block is given, an enumerator itself is returned instead. The docs explaination pretty much clearly articulates what this method does. <br>
           So in plain english the map method when ran will give you a new array based on the results of running through each element through the block. For example is you have a collection of strings and they were all in the lowercase form and you wanted them all to be capitalized, you would run the array_name.map through a block that contained a variable and a function that instructs you to call .upcase on the array -> variable.upcase. And this would return the result that we were looking for.</p>
