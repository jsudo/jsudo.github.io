                  <p>Arrays can best be describe as orderly holding containers that can be acessed with their numerical value. Similiar to these solar panels below each is carefully place in an acurate position, more than likely numerically space an equal distance apart and within the approximate distance away from the nearest panel. I think pictures can describe this best because the orderliness of arrays are the key feature that make arrays the go to solution for when you want to sequentually store data in a place that can be accessed in an orderly fashion. With arrays, order is the key.

                  Hashes to me are similiar to a rubiks cube(a rubiks cube that stores things). The key value pairs match up to unlock whatever you are looking for. By matching the adjacent colors together you unlock the contents of the cube. In this instance the one color would be the key and the other would be the value. And we also could store data based on color. We could store one type of data in the orange group, while storing another type of data in the green group. We could go on and on like this for each color. This is what makes hashes ideal over arrays is the ability to randomly store things in unordered collections based on made up keys and values.
