**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**  

  I learned that using em and percentages get the job done a lot easier then using pixels. And I learned that borders and padding can get kind of tricky, but I just need to remember that padding pads the content and borders protect them.   


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**  

I learned that positioning is one of the most difficult aspects of css. Just getting the simplest element to sit in the correct space on your screen could literally take a whole day, if you dont know what you are doing. 

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**  

Positioning by far was the most difficult to implement because it seem like the only task that continually kept causing conflicts with the other elements on the page.  

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**  

I learned that adding and formating elements are easy when you use classes and id's, a lot easier then adding it directly to the html.
